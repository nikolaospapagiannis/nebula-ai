## Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in good faith to be authorized. We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make good faith effort to avoid privacy violations
- Do not exploit issues beyond verification
- Report directly to us before public disclosure
- Give reasonable time to address issues

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Configuration

```bash
# Generate secure secrets
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

# Never use defaults in production
# Use environment variables, not .env files
```

### Checklist

- [ ] Change all default passwords
- [ ] Enable HTTPS only
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Regular security updates
