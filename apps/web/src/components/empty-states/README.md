## Dashboard Integration

The dashboard page (`/apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`) has been updated to:

1. **Track Setup Progress:** State management for onboarding completion
   ```tsx
   const [setupProgress, setSetupProgress] = useState({
     profileComplete: false,
     calendarConnected: false,
     firstMeeting: false,
     teamInvited: false,
   });
   ```

2. **Detect New Users:** Logic to identify completely new users
   ```tsx
   const isNewUser = meetings.length === 0 && !setupProgress.firstMeeting;
   ```

3. **Conditional Rendering:**
   - Show `EmptyDashboard` for brand new users (full onboarding experience)
   - Show `EmptyRecentMeetings` when meetings section is empty
   - Show `EmptyTopics` in topics section
   - Show regular dashboard with data once user has content

## Design Principles

### 1. No Mocks or Placeholders
- All components use real data and state
- Setup progress tracked based on actual user data
- Links point to real routes
- No dummy data or fake content

### 2. Meaningful Guidance
- Clear explanations of what each feature does
- Benefits-focused messaging
- Progressive disclosure (don't overwhelm)
- Encouraging, friendly tone

### 3. Actionable CTAs
- Every empty state has clear next steps
- Primary actions use gradient buttons for emphasis
- Secondary actions available where appropriate
- Direct links to relevant pages/features

### 4. Visual Polish
- Glassmorphism design matching app aesthetic
- Color-coded icons for visual organization
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Decorative elements for visual interest

## Color Themes

Components use consistent color theming:
- **Blue:** Meetings, video, uploads
- **Purple:** Calendar, integrations
- **Teal/Cyan:** Primary actions, AI features
- **Emerald:** Team, collaboration
- **Orange:** External tools, extensions

## Responsive Design

All components are fully responsive:
- Mobile: Single column layout, stacked buttons
- Tablet: 2-column grid for action cards
- Desktop: Full multi-column layouts with sidebars

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- Clear contrast ratios
- Focus states for keyboard navigation
- Icon + text combinations
- Descriptive aria labels where needed
